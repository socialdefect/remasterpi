Not much to see in here yet and still quite a lot to do!
Testers and contributers are more than welcome!!

Latest update:

	Here you'll find a complete re-make of RemasterPi.
	The SD build script has been removed and will be replaced by a pre-built base image
	The scripts directory will be replaced by a separate git repo later-on

	This project is not yet usable by end-users. If you like to help-out with development
	and testing please check-out our forum: http://sourceforge.net/p/remasterpi/discussion

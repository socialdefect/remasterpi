Using RemasterPi is quite simple since its made to be as easy as possible.

	Configuration:

		1) The first thing you want to do is run the initial system configuration. This takes care of your SD card partitions and basic system settings.
		2) Next you need to set the default user mode, this can be set to 'easy' or 'expert'
			- easy: Installs scripts without asking any questions
			- expert: Asks the user for input when a script supports it. This enables you to slightly customize the scripts.
		3) The RemasterPi update script will update the script directory to include the latest scripts
		4) The Auto-Start Configuration can be disabled when you are finished customizing so the system will no longer start RemasterPi at boot

	Scripts:

		1) Before installing scripts it is wise to run a RemasterPi update first
		2) All scripts include an info file which describes all features the script will install for you in detail






	TODO:

		*) Include a backup feature
		*) Fix Bugs
		*) Include feature requests
